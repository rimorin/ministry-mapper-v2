## 📖 Overview

Ministry Mapper is a modern, cloud-based web application designed to digitize field ministry territory management. Built with cutting-edge technologies, it replaces traditional paper-based systems with real-time collaboration, interactive mapping, and comprehensive tracking capabilities.

**Version 2** represents a complete architectural overhaul from Firebase to [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io), eliminating vendor lock-in while providing superior querying capabilities and full data control.

## ✨ Key Benefits

### 🌱 Environmental Impact

Eliminate paper waste and reduce your congregation's carbon footprint while improving legibility and durability of territory records.

### ⚡ Real-Time Collaboration

Live updates keep all users synchronized, minimizing overlap and maximizing territory coverage efficiency.

### 🌍 Universal Access

Cloud-based platform enables ministry work to continue smoothly, regardless of territory conductor availability.

### 📱 Modern Experience

Progressive Web App (PWA) technology provides native app-like experience on any device, installable on mobile and desktop.

   ```env
   VITE_POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:8090
   VITE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT=local
   VITE_OPENROUTE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   VITE_LOCATIONIQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
   VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
   VITE_PRIVACY_URL=https://your-site.com/privacy
   VITE_TERMS_URL=https://your-site.com/terms
